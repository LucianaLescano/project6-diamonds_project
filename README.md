# Diamonds Project

This week’s project is all about Machine Learning models.
I participated in a Kaggle competition!

## How? 🤓

I was given a dataset with information about diamonds, all its characteristics and price. You can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diamonds-datamad1020-rev).
Thru Machine Learning models I had to predict the price of diamonds. 
Also if you want to know who wins it, just click the link and watch it for yourself 👀.

## What did I did? 📝

In this repo you will three folders.
1. Data:
Here it is all the data used in this project, from the original dataset to the final dataset used for the contest. 
2. Notebook:
Here you will find six notebooks that contains the process of this project. 
Managing and cleaning the data, then four different machine learning models.
3. Src:
Files with functions used to processing the dataset.

## Resources 🛠

- Pandas ([documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/))
- SciKit Learn ([documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/))


## As always 💁🏽‍♀️
